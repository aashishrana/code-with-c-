Element should be in monotonic function (sort)

In Binary search first find the mid 
Run a loop while(start < end) inside loop compare values 
 then compare the value (element) with the mid 
 if the value is equal to mid then return mid
 if the value is less than mid that means element found in left part
 again find the mid  of the left part 
 and then compare with the value if equal to mid then return mid else same process going on
 and the same if the value is greater then the mid then found in the right part


 In binary search time complexity is logn in worst case 
 n/2^k;
